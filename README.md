As the seasons change, so do the activities available during a vacation. Living in Barcelona, one of Europe’s top travel destinations, I’m often asked by friends and family for suggestions on things to do when they visit. Typically, these trips are short (1 - 7 days), lasting just one to three days. To make planning easier, I’m developing TIP, an AI-powered Travel Itinerary Planner using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This tool tailors itineraries for short trips in Barcelona, taking into account the weather, activity preferences, and duration of stay.
