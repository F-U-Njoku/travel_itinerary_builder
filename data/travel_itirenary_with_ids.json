[{"itinerary": "Travel itinerary for one days.", "plan": "\n08:45 \u2013 Pla\u00e7a Catalunya\nNo slouching, I expect you to be showered, dressed and breakfasted by now, and you should have made your way to Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, the city\u2019s bustling central square.\n08:45 \u2013 09:15 \u2013 Passeig de Gracia\nFrom here make your way up the magnificent boulevard Passeig de Gracia by foot. This has to be one of the best looking streets in the world. Keep going up until you reach the so called \u2018Block of Discord\u2019 on your left, a single block that showcases three of Barcelona\u2019s best architects in one: starting with the Casa Lleo i Morera by Luis Domenech i Montaner, then the Casa Amatller by Puig y Cadalfach, and finishing with the astonishing Casa Batllo, by none other than Antoni Gaudi.\n09:30 \u2013 Casa Mila\nThe embarrassment of architectural riches continues on the other side of the street with Gaudi\u2019s Casa Mila, a vast monolithic mansion with curves like Kim Kardashian. Take a good look! You don\u2019t have time to enter any of these astonishing buildings however, because you\u2019ve got a date with God. Get on board the Blue Line of the Hop On, Hop Off Tourist Bus and alight at the next stop.\n10:00 \u2013 Sagrada Familia\nYou don\u2019t have to be religious to sense the divine in this breathtaking homage to the big guy upstairs. Gaudi was an ardent Catholic and he dedicated the later years of his life to this impossibly grandiose edifice, every square foot of which is decorated in religious allegories, natural motifs and mathematical equations. This one you can\u2019t miss, so buy yourself a skip-the-line ticket. Personally I would advise buying a ticket that includes audioguide, which you can do via Get Your Guide.\nNote: if you\u2019re following this itinerary exactly, you might be better off buying the Barcelona Pass as it includes Tourist Bus, Sagrada Familia and Park Guell, leaving you done and dusted with one handy purchase!\n11:30 \u2013 Tourist Bus\nHowever mesmerising La Sagrada proves, don\u2019t tarry too long\u2026 you need to hustle and get back on the Blue Line of the tourist bus. Your love affair with Gaudi ain\u2019t over yet. Get off two stops later.\n12:00 \u2013 Park Guell\nExcuse me for a minute whilst I get nostalgic for the times when Parc Guell was free and half empty, and I used to pop up there just to enjoy the serene beauty of the place. Sadly, in these days of readily accessible travel, we now have to wait our turn (and pay!) for such privileges \u2013 so please go online and book your tickets in advance (you\u2019ve got a loooonng wait if you don\u2019t!).\nOnce you\u2019ve passed through the art nouveau gates of Gaudi\u2019s garden, you\u2019ll soon see what all the fuss is about. From the majestic white staircase, with techni-colour lizard on guard, to the wide open terrace with undulating trencadis-covered benches and views over almost the entire city, this is a truly special place.\nOh what the hell, take a selfie\u2026 everyone else is!\n13:30 \u2013 Lunch in Gracia\nLunch time! Leave yourself about 15 or 20 minutes and descend from Park Guell down into the chic Bohemian district of Gracia. This used to be a separate village to Barcelona, and indeed the (fiercely Catalan) locals still consider themselves distinct from downtowners. The barri is chock-full of affordable tapas bars and restaurants, so take your pick. You\u2019ll find a few suggestions in our Restaurants section, where you can filter the location for \u2018Gracia\u2019.\n15:00 \u2013 Ride the Blue Line\nBy now your legs are a little weary and your stomach a little bloated. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve scheduled you a nice easy afternoon\u2026\nIt\u2019s time to get back to the tourist bus stop, and ride the Blue Line all the way, through the pleasant Zona Alta neighbourhoods, to the other side of the city where the legendary Camp Nou football stadium awaits. Depending on whether you\u2019re a sports fan or not, you might want to get off here and enjoy The Bar\u00e7a Immersive experience. You can buy advance tickets via Get Your Guide (note: the stadium itself is closed for refurbishment until Nov 2024, but you can still tour the museum and check out those gleaming trophies).\nNote: The 16:00 or 16:30 time slot for the Camp Nou Experience should fit this itinerary (it might take a bit over an hour to get there via tourist bus after lunch, 30-40 mins on the bus, plus the time you need to get from the restaurant to the bus stop and wait for the next bus to arrive).\nNot a big Bar\u00e7a fan? Then just enjoy the bus tour of the city and alight at the Francesc Macia roundabout, where you\u2019re going to change onto the Red Line of the tourist bus route.\n16:30 \u2013 Ride the Red Line\nFrom Francesc Macia, the Red Line of the tourist bus will take you to Pla\u00e7a Espanya, where you will spy the eye-catching Las Arenas shopping centre (it was once a bullfighting arena, and it shows!), before taking a very enjoyable ride through the leafy hills of Montjuic mountain.\nEnjoy the bus ride over Montjuic hill, with its parks and museums\nThis green space is full of parkland and cultural treasures, and you might want to alight at any of the Joan Miro Foundation, Olympic Stadium, or Miramar viewing point, if you have time.\nWith a bit of luck you should reach the Columbus Statue around 18:00. (If you stopped for Camp Nou you\u2019re probably behind schedule, so plan accordingly!).\n18:00 \u2013 Las Ramblas\nThe 60-metre-high column with the New World explorer on top is your sign to get off the bus. You\u2019re at the bottom of Las Ramblas, the city\u2019s (in)famous thoroughfare. You wouldn\u2019t want to have to cross this street every day, as its positively jam-packed with tourists, but on the other hand, you wouldn\u2019t want to miss it either. It\u2019s a wide, lively street, flanked by theatres, restaurants and palaces. You can read more here.\nWalk up La Rambla, from Colombus back up to Pl. Catalunya\nAs you head up Las Ramblas, navigate a little bit to the right in order to discover the lively Pla\u00e7a Reial, possibly my favourite square in the city. You might want to come back here at night for a beer!\nBe sure to pop by the Placa Reial\nWhilst on the left of Las Ramblas, as you head up, you\u2019ll pass not only La Boqueria food market (pop in and get yourself some freshly squeezed juice) but also the historic Liceu Theatre.\nYou\u2019ll also pass all manner of artists, street performers, vendors, hawkers, florists, kiosks and souvenir sellers.\nIf it\u2019s cold outside you could nip down to Petrixol street (on the right) and grab a hot chocolate from one of the traditional cafes there.\nAfter that it\u2019s time to get back to your hotel and get changed for the evening.\n19:45 \u2013 Flamenco & Dinner\nIf you really want to do it all in one day, then round off your Barcelona itinerary with a flamenco show and dinner. There are several great tablaos (concert venues) to choose from, and I\u2019d suggest either this affordable flamenco & tapas evening, or else a show at Tablao Cordobes on Las Ramblas.\nTablao Cordobes offers three or four shows a night, and you can buy a ticket with a drink, with Spanish tapas or will full Spanish dinner, so check what times and options work for you. Shows tend to sell out so best to buy tickets via Get Your Guide (select the date first, and then you will see the different meal options and times).\nRound off your Barcelona experience with a flamenco show\u2026\nIf flamenco isn\u2019t your bag baby, then you can\u2019t go wrong with dinner at El Nacional, a refined food court where four different restaurants and four more bars offer tastes from all corners of Spain.\nMore things to do at night here.\n22:00 \u2013 Nightcap\nYou\u2019ve really packed it in today, so reward yourself with a nice refreshing libation. For cocktails try Slow cocktail bar or La Whiskeria.\nIf you find yourself in the Gothic Quarter, then head over to Milk, or one of the bars on Pla\u00e7a Reial (I like Oca\u00f1a the best).\nChilling out in style at Slow\n00:00 \u2013 Bed Time?\nBed time! Unless of course you truly want to make this a 24 hours in Barcelona experience and party until dawn with the city\u2019s cool cats and night owls. \t\nFinal Advice\nI tried to leave as much time as might be needed to get from a. to b. during this itinerary, but if you are buying tickets with specific entry times be sure to leave some extra wiggle room. If you are travelling with children, stop for excessive amount of selfies, enjoy long lunches or get unlucky with the buses / traffic, you may hit some of these stops later than I predicted here.\nAlso, as ever with Barcelona, be vigilant about pickpockets, especially on the metro, Las Ramblas, and in the winding streets of the Old Town (Gothic Quarter, El Born etc.). The city is very safe, but unguarded possessions (like bags left under tables) are often swiped by opportunistic thieves.\n", "itin_vector": [0.0006541923503391445, 0.008398891426622868,

Catalan capital.\nMorning: Discovering Gaudi (Day 1)\nArguably the world\u2019s most famous architect, few cities owe as much to one man as Barcelona does to Antoni Gaudi, a genius who helped define the city\u2019s aesthetic and its proud, creative and singular soul.\nI\u2019d suggest warming up to his visionary outlook with a walk up the majestic Passeig de Gracia, a wide and leafy boulevard full of designer shops and Modernista architecture. Here you\u2019ll find two of Gaudi\u2019s most famous creations.\nCasa Mila (La Pedrera)\nCasa Mila is nicknamed La Pedrera, or The Quarry, because of its imposing, undulating fa\u00e7ade that amazingly doesn\u2019t contain a single straight line. The interior is impressive too, with its stairwell, preserved 19th century apartment and slaloming rooftop. Day tickets are \u20ac25 and available on Tiqets.com, or return at night for La Pedrera: Night Experience for a guided tour that finishes with a light show on the iconic rooftop.\nCasa Batllo\nCasa Batllo, meanwhile, is so strikingly different you might struggle to believe it\u2019s by the same architect. A rather dainty, coral-coloured edifice, it is nicknamed the House of Bones thanks to its skeletal appearance \u2013 the balconies seem fashioned from shark skulls. Day tickets are \u20ac35 and available on Tiqets.com. During summer months you can also buy a ticket for their Magic Night series of rooftop concerts.\nLa Sagrada Familia\nLa Sagrada Familia is Gaud\u2019s crowning glory. An epic labour of love that is yet unfinished (the aim is to get it done before 2026, which will mark the centenary of the architect\u2019s death), the scale of this basilica and the myriad details and sculptures of its four distinct fa\u00e7ades really need to be seen to be believed. The interior is no less impressive, with a forest of white pillars soaring up in a nave lit by rainbow of light from the stained glass windows. Tickets cost \u20ac33.80 via Tiqets.com, or \u20ac46.80 if you want to climb one of the towers (recommended). La Sagrada is about 20-25 minute walk from the two mansions on Passeig de Gracia.\nAfternoon: Old Town Treasures (Day 1)\nBarcelona grew out of a Roman fort and trading post into a walled medieval city and the heart of the Great Enchantress still lies in the historic districts of El Gotico, El Born and El Raval.\nGothic Quarter and Cathedral\nEl Gotico, or the Gothic Quarter is the most interesting for tourists, the cynosure of which is the Gothic Cathedral. The cathedral\u2019s symmetry and style are a stark contrast to the bombastic Sagrada Familia, while a tour of the cloister with its 13 geese and the chance to walk the rooftop are good fun.\nIn fact, you can\u2019t throw a hot patata brava without hitting a church in the Gothic Quarter, and just wondering the narrow winding streets of the Old Town is a rare pleasure, as elegant spires or imposing religious fa\u00e7ades pop up around every corner. Similarly ubiquitous are charming plazas where you can invariably find a terrace to enjoy some tapas or a cheeky cerveza.\nPla\u00e7a Reial\nSpeaking of squares, Pla\u00e7a Reial is the most becoming: the ochre houses, the lofty palm trees, a classy fountain and street lamps designed by Gaudi, set it apart from the others. This Pla\u00e7a is also home to a plethora of restaurants, bars and clubs and a good place to find a spot of nightlife.\n Barcelona History Museum (Roman Ruins)\nFor history buffs, the central branch of the MUHBA offers an unmissable insight into Barcelona\u2019s origins, including a look at the well-preserved Roman ruins that lie underneath the city. Other museums include the rather fun Frederic Mares Museum, while you can see the remains of the Temple of Augustus for free.\nEvening: Flamenco & Tapas (Day 1)\nIf you\u2019ve never experienced a flamenco show, this southern Spanish song and dance has a strong presence in Barcelona, dating back to the days of the legendary Carmen Amaya. There are several great tablaos in Barcelona, which you can read about here.\nNaturally, you\u2019ll want to dine out on traditional Spanish cuisine on your first night in the city. The custom of sharing these small plates of seafood, cured meats, cheeses and plenty of fried treats is a lot of fun, and I suggest you check out my list of recommended tapas restaurants, which also includes a guide to the classic tapas you might want to try.\nOf course you could combine both flamenco and tapas in one evening, with this one activity available on Get Your Guide\n \nMorning: Parks & Recreation (Day 2)\nOn your second day, I\u2019d recommend checking out the sights on the edge of the city, like Park Guell, Camp Nou, and the many cultural treasures of Montjuic. Barcelona\u2019s Tourist Bus does a pretty good job of joining these up, although it can get crowded in high season, so I\u2019d recommend setting off early to get to Park Guell for example. Otherwise, Barcelona\u2019s metro is cheap and reliable, and the majority of trains are now air-conditioned (but not all!).\nPark Guell\nGaudi\u2019s landscaped gardens form a leafy retreat just outside the city centre, and I\u2019d advise any visitor to check them out. Highlights are the Dragon Staircase, guarded by a mosaic-coated salamander lizard, which has become one of the symbols of the city, and the oval terrace, with its snaking seating and views over the entire city. Reserve a time slot via Tiqets.com (or consider buying the aforementioned Barcelona Pass, also available on Tiqets).\nCamp Nou\nSports fans won\u2019t need more encouragement to stop off at the legendary home of FC Barcelona, and see the hallowed turfs where the likes of Cruyff, Maradona and Messi all plied their trade. Undergoing renovation at the time of press it should be available to visit in 2024.\nMontjuic\nThis leafy coastal rise on the edge of the city is covered in parks, gardens and an assortment cultural treasures. Take your pick from Poble Espanyol, MNAC, Joan Miro Foundation, Botanical Gardens or the Olympic Ring. One cool thing to do is ride the Teleferic Cable Car up to Montjuic Castle at the top of the hill.\nAfternoon: The Beach & El Born (Day 2)\nIf you followed my morning itinerary it will likely be quite late in the day already by the time you finish up, so reward yourself with a stroll or cocktail by the beach, before heading into the lively and picturesque El Born district. If you have energy for one more cultural treasure, make it the Picasso Museum\u2026 otherwise just start stocking up on the tapas and beers!\nBarceloneta Beach\nBarcelona\u2019s most famous beach is a lively hub of sun worshippers, sports lovers, chiringuitos (beach bars), urban sculptures, and holiday makers sipping sangria on restaurant terraces. Don\u2019t expect too much towel space or peace and quiet, but go for the atmosphere instead.\nPicasso Museum\nThis expansive tribute to the 20th century\u2019s greatest artist focuses on his early works, many of which were brushed up right here in Barcelona, before he left Spain to live in Paris. An insight into his Blue and Rose periods provide context into his development as a Cubist.\nPasseig del Born\nThis elongated, tree-lined square is one of the most attractive plazas in Barcelona and practically every address is a bar or restaurant. Whether you fancy an ice cream, crepe, slice of pizza, tapas, vermouth or cocktail, you can refuel and enjoy the vibe.\nEvening: Paella & Cocktails (Day 2)\nSure you could order paella at a restaurant, but what about rounding off your 48 hrs in Barcelona with a paella cooking class. Learning how to rustle up this renowned Spanish rice dish is a lot of fun, and the end results will be delicious thanks to the advice of your expert local chef and fresh local ingredients used to make it.\nWith dinner taken care of, put the finishing touches to your perfect Barcelona weekend itinerary by dropping into one of the city\u2019s foremost coctelerias. The art of mixology has taken off in a big way in Barna, so kick back and sip away.\nMore Cool Options\nHere are three more cool things to do on a two day visit to Barcelona.\n1. Take a Bike Tour\nInstead of discovering Gaudi on foot, on the morning of Day 1, how about saddling up and taking a tour of his UNESCO listed architecture by bike? This way you get to see pretty much everything the Catalan genius created in one morning, along with several other scenic spots in the city. Check out the Gaudi UNESCO Highlights Tour by Gaudi Bike Tours if that sounds like a good idea! (You could be even more ambitious and take an electric bike tour that covers both Gaudi and Montjuic in 4ish hours. In which case check out the Barcelona Photo Highlights Tour by Ocean Bikes).\n2. Go Sailing!\nTake advantage of Barcelona\u2019s alluring Mediterranean situation, by signing up for a trip on board a sailing yacht. Tours leave several times a day from the Port Olimpic, and some are as short as 1.5 hrs, meaning they can easily be fit into a weekend visit. Take a look at our recommended sailing experiences (including private yacht hire), or go right ahead and book this affordable 1.5hr trip with snacks and vermouth organised by Sailing Experience BCN. \t\t \t\n\n3. Make Your Own Espadrilles\nDuring this fun-loving creative workshop you get to grip with the iconic Iberian espadrille, personalising your own set of Spanish sandals, as you learn a little bit of the history behind this working class shoe, beloved by Dali, Picasso and many more. In fact, they\u2019ve never gone out of fashion and a pair of these traditional beauties will set you back in the region of \u20ac100\u2026 luckily this class costs only \u20ac84.90 when you take advantage of the \u20ac15 BARCELONALIFE discount when checking out. Available at 10am and 4pm each day.\n", "itin_vector": [0.011410843580961227, 0.01575099304318428, -0.040479473769664764, -0.007030633743852377, -0.038950011134147644, -0.02169925533235073,

1\nSagrada Familia\nForget three days in Barcelona: if you had just a single hour in Barcelona, the world-famous Sagrada Familia would be the only stop.\nThis art nouveau basilica is called \u2018the most extraordinary interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages\u2019. The UNESCO World Heritage Site receives 4.5 million annual visitors.\nThe way Catalan wonder architect Antoni Gaudi depicts the energy of new life on the Nativity Fa\u00e7ade and the cruelty of death on the Passion Fa\u00e7ade is great pause for reflection.\nCasa Batll\u00f2\nOn Barcelona\u2019s second most famous street (Passeig de Gracia) we get into the heart of the Ruta del Modernisme.\nThe showcase piece is the beautifully eccentric mansion by Antoni Gaudi called Casa Batllo, and it\u2019s another must for 3 days in Barcelona.\nStand outside and appreciate the building\u2019s visceral, skeletal qualities. The colourful mosaic facade was crafted using broken tea cups from local factories.\nInside we get a great insight into the mind of a genius. Gaudi designed the ergonomic house inch by inch right down to the doorknobs.\nAdmission includes an augmented reality tour, the Gaudi Cube, and a visit to the dragon\u2019s back roof terrace.\nLunch Near Casa Batllo\nHonestly, we\u2019re in tourist trap hell here so we\u2019re going to have to dodge some bullets.\nRight up the street from Casa Batllo though is El Nacional. This multi-zone culinary space serves traditional recipes from nearly every region in Spain. It\u2019s also got a wine bar, cocktail bar, and oyster bar.\nFish lovers also can\u2019t go wrong at Chao Pescao. Here chefs cook fresh fish that you\u2019ve selected yourself from a Barcelona market counter. I never go solo here \u2013 get some local Blanc Pescador white wine.\nLa Pedrera (aka Casa Mil\u00e0)\nYou\u2019ll barely even have started to digest lunch before my Barcelona itinerary offers another jewel of the city\u2019s architectural crown.\nLa Pedrera is another Gaudi work (surprise, surprise) and it is arguably his best. It\u2019s just a short five minute walk from Casa Batllo.\nThis wobbling limestone apartment block is best known for its \u2018Garden of Warriors\u2019 rooftop. Getting a photo of yourself and the haunting chimneys standing on guard is another must do.\nThe Casa Mila apartment itself is a great way to see how upper class families lived in central Barcelona at the turn of last century.\nCasa Vicens\nHeading further up Passeig de Gracia you\u2019ll find the neighbourhood of Gracia for one of Barcelona\u2019s most underrated attractions: the newly minted Gaudi gem Casa Vicens.\nThis summer chalet mansion with its lush garden is more fairy tale than home and at less than half the price of its contemporaries it offers a tremendous amount of value for both Gaudi fanatics and budget travelers.\nIf you\u2019re not planning on visiting Casa Batllo or La Pedrera then this would be the best way to experience Gaudi\u2019s home architecture expertise up close.\nGrab a Paella Dinner\nYou\u2019ve only got 3 days in Barcelona so make your dinner choices wisely.\nOf course, if you\u2019re visiting Barcelona let me know where you\u2019re staying and I\u2019ll recommend you some of the best restaurants in Barcelona near your hotel.\nIn general, there are tons of options but a great Spanish introduction to the city is via a paella tasting menu at Bodega Joan. Other great restaurants near our Barcelona attractions for day one include Lasarte and Can Boneta.\n \nBarcelona\u2019s Best Breakfast\nIn winter we\u2019re starting the day with breakfast in Barcelona city center eating delicious churros con chocolate on historic Petrixol Street.\nIf it\u2019s summer we\u2019re heading to the even more historic La Boqueria Market for fruit smoothies and tostadas. \nIf you\u2019re looking for something a bit more savory then Boqueria Market\u2019s Bar Pinotxo has a classic breakfast here with blood sausage and garbanzo beans.\nLas Ramblas\nWhen speaking of Las Ramblas, the famous Spanish poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca once said \"it\u2019s the only street I wish would never end\".\nOf course, Las Ramblas may have lost the shine of yesteryear (mass tourism has added its share of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts) but it\u2019s still Barcelona\u2019s most famous street.\nIn particular, we should be looking at the street performers at the bottom the street. La Boqueria Market is also a must, and it\u2019s a great place to pop in some some classic Iberian ham or a cheap fruit smoothie.\nThe Secrets of the Old City: Gothic Quarter Tour\nI also suggest immersing yourself in Barcelona\u2019s rich history, current political landscape, and future prospects with a 2.5-hour tour of the Gothic Quarter led by expert guides.\nThese walking tours are conducted by top-notch professionals who masterfully blend education and entertainment, revealing the secrets of La Rambla, Boqueria Market, Barcelona Cathedral, Pla\u00e7a Sant Felipe Neri, Augustus Temple, the Jewish Quarter (El Call), and beyond.\nAlong the way, you\u2019ll discover a favorite spot of Picasso, indulge in one of Barcelona\u2019s most delightful snack locations, and marvel at abundant street art.\nTraditional Spanish Lunch\nIt\u2019s 12:30.\nThe walking tour ends in the heart of the Ciutat Vella (Old City) so we\u2019ve got some options: if you wanna be quick it\u2019s the bite-sized toothpick tapas at El Pintxo del Petrixol.\nAccording to a Catalan friend it\u2019s \u2018the only restaurant near La Rambla that doesn\u2019t serve garbage\u2019.\nAnother option for more of an elaborate Spanish meal is La Fonda which is a great place to get some of the best paella in Barcelona at outskirts prices.\nPark Guell\nWhen asked what to do in Barcelona for 3 days I\u2019d put Park Guell in must-see territory. It\u2019s the city\u2019s most beautiful park.\nWe take bus 24 from Passeig de Gracia and 30-40 minutes later we\u2019re left at the gates. We could also take the yellow Barcelona metro line to Alfons X and walk 15 minutes.\nOur reward at the end is Antoni Gaudi\u2019s utopian park vision, which its gingerbread-like porter\u2019s house and famous mosaic salamander. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll get a fantastic panoramic view of the city\nIt\u2019ll take 90-120 minutes depending on how much of the Free Zone we care to see.\nBarcelona\u2019s Most Famous Aperitivo\nFor any tourist doing Barcelona in 3 days this is that when in Rome moment.\nIn particular your travel tipple should involve either a vermut (vermouth, a fortified and spiced wine) or una ca\u00f1a (a small, refreshing glass of beer).\nThis is best done in nearby Gracia\u2019s charming squares: especially Pla\u00e7a del Sol.\nIn particular, I\u2019d go to the bar Sol Soler (one of my Barcelona hidden gems) as they have a massive terrace to soak up the sun.\nCasa Lopez is another great option if you\u2019d like to fit in some homemade tapas.\nBoth are just a 15-20 minute downhill walk from the park.\nModern Spanish for Dinner\nYou\u2019re likely staying central and will have to ninja your way around a ton of tourist traps \u2013 but luckily I\u2019ve found the only authentic restaurant on La Rambla: El Louro.\nSpanish tapas classics are given a modern twist here and mains like the Galician beef filet and crunchy octopus are to die for. The kicker? They make some of the best original cocktails in the city.\nA Night Out for Drinks\nBarcelona\u2019s best bars offer a little bit of everything, though if you visit Barcelona you\u2019ll probably want something unique.\nFor this reason I suggest the high-end cocktails at Dry Martini \u2013 it has actually been voted the 6th best bar in the world \u2013 and it\u2019s one of my best things to do at night in Barcelona.\nAs for clubbing? Of course I\u2019m going to suggest you read my post on the best clubs in Barcelona.\nMy first choice would be Razzmatazz, a massive five room club. Each room plays a different type of urban music: hip hop, house, dancehall, R&B, reggaeton, and even some rock\nThe second choice is Sala Apolo, a former theater that\u2019s been transformed into one of Barcelona\u2019s most famous clubs.\n \nSleeping In\nPart of us came on holiday to relax, am I right? So here\u2019s where you can chill on your 3 days in Barcelona.\nLet\u2019s roll out of bed at 10:00 am.\nOn day three of our itinerary we\u2019re grabbing a quick breakfast like a Barcelona local: heading downstairs, finding the closest cafe, and getting a croissant and cortado (a coffee with a splash of milk).\nSlow and steady will be the game today.\nShopping or Camp Nou?\nWe\u2019ve got two choices now and I\u2019ll leave it up to you, my distinguished guests.\nThere\u2019s tons of world-class shopping in Barcelona city center. The largest shopping areas are Passeig de Gracia, Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, Las Ramblas and Portal del Angel. Here you can great some of the best Barcelona souvenirs too.\nIf we\u2019re allergic to shopping (I really am!) we really have to ask ourselves what Barcelona itinerary wouldn\u2019t include a tour of historic Camp Nou stadium \u2013 home of that little squad called FC Barcelona.\nFrom Pla\u00e7a Catalunya we get there in 15 minutes with the green metro line getting off at Les Corts.\nBeach at La Barceloneta\nBarceloneta is a great neighborhood to explore inner alleyways where elderly residents sit outside playing cards while young people gather to socialize in kitschy bars.\nIt\u2019s one of the best beaches in Barcelona. For the early afternoon (like locals) you\u2019ll want to work on that tan \u2013 the cleanest waters for a summertime dipa re in the corner near the W Hotel (the sail shaped-one).\nAfter, we can\u2019t stop by without saying hello to Mrs. Leo, a little spark-plug of a woman in her 70\u2019s who owns a bar where on weekend afternoons Andalusian Barcelona flamenco and live Spanish guitar is the name of the game!\nBar Leo is at 34 Carrer Sant Carles.\nSunday Lunch\nWe\u2019re getting really local now by having a late lunch (around 3:00 pm) and for this I\u2019d recommend going for quality tapas at Bitacora \u2013 at the back of the restaurant there\u2019s a cool little terrace.\nThere\u2019s also the ridiculously cheap wine bar La Champagneria. We also can\u2019t miss the minuscule fried fish restaurant Can Ma\u00f1o.\nAll places are fifteen minutes or less walking from the beach.\nLooking for something closer to home? One of Barcelona\u2019s best burgers is just what the doctor ordered. Kiosko Burger is a great place to start and it\u2019s no tourist sin! Get the one with traditional manchego cheese.\nMontjuic\nWe get to Montjuic Hill by taking the Port Cable Car from Barceloneta or the Montjuic Cable Car from further down the hill.\nAt the top of Barcelona\u2019s tallest hill we find the Montjuic Castle with its majestic view of the harbour, the Miro Foundation, the \u201992 Olympic Stadiums and the botanical garden.\nThere\u2019s also the option to experience the fantastic open-air architecture museum Poble Espanyol (ironically, Barcelona architecture is nowhere to be found!)\nThe Magic Fountain\nThis beautiful fountain of towering water sprays to the rhythm of contemporary music \u2013 the view of Pla\u00e7a Espanya is really something!\nWe find the fountain a short fifteen minute walk away at the foot of Montjuic. Make sure to check the Barcelona Magic Fountain show schedule first.\nDinner\nWe\u2019re looking to keep it local for the third night so we hit up Can Margarit for some authentic Catalan fare. Here it\u2019s all about rustic charm, cask wines, rabbit, squid, and cod.\nFor 3 days in Barcelona, you should be able to spoil yourself a bit: try Mano Rota, an inventive Peruvian-Japanese fusion spot that\u2019s earned a Michelin star.\nLooking for something a little cheaper?\nHead for the street called Calle Blai and its endless supply of one euro tapas and beer bars. I recommend La Tasqueta de Blai.\nAfter Dinner\nIn the Gotico area we\u2019ll head to Manu Chao\u2019s bar. This incredibly eclectic French singer who sings in 7 languages sometimes shows up to play guitar.\nThe bar is called Mariachi. Of course, I\u2019ve been a little pushy with my ideas haven\u2019t I? We\u2019d actually be good going to any of Barcelona\u2019s best bars.\nThat\u2019s 3 perfect days in Barcelona down!\n3 Day Barcelona Itinerary \u2013 Honourable Mentions\nTibidabo Mountain\nTibidabo Mountain (I will give you in Latin) is a 3 in 1: a basilica with a gigantic statue of Christ, the highest panoramic view of the city, and a 25-ride retro theme park. The latter is truly unique for the antique rides like the airplane one from 1928.\nThis is a must for Barcelona travelers with kids.\nYou can get there in 45 minutes from the Estacio del Nord with bus T2A.\nIf you don\u2019t feel like the long bus ride we can just as easily spend a few hours in centrally-located Ciutadella Park. Parc de la Ciutadella is the city\u2019s largest green space, has a zoo, and is famous for a lake where you can rent rowboats.\nThe Born\nDespite its history of medieval jousting, the Born District is an area full of unique bars and boutique shops.\nYou can\u2019t walk through without seeing Barcelona\u2019s second Gothic behemoth: La Santa Maria del Mar. What I like about the Santa Maria del Mar is that it\u2019s one of the best free things to do in Barcelona.\nWe could also check out the more than 4000 pieces at the Picasso Museum.\nTapas Lunch in a Square\nWhen you get hungry fill yourself up at one of my favourite El Born tapas spots: Bormuth.\nI mentioned it before, but if you\u2019re up for a drink you should be drinking vermouth on your itinerary.\nThis a red or white aromatized wine is a massive part of Barcelona\u2019s drinking culture. They pair perfectly at Bormuth with patatas bravas (pictured), a type of potato wedge tapa with spicy sauce.\nEven better? Out here you get your first experience of true Barcelona square culture. Watching the world go by in Pla\u00e7a Comercial is another Barcelona past time to check off on your list.\nRaval\nFor those a little more rough and ready I suggest we go for a 20 minute walk to get to the \u2018gentrified gem\u2019 El Raval.\nThere are tons of good value bars and ethnically diverse eateries here \u2013 if you\u2019ve skipped my tapas advice above there\u2019s no shame getting a \u20ac5.00 curry lunch on the fly at Bismillah (Carrer Joaquin Costa 22).\nThen you can round out the afternoon going to one of my favourite contemporary museums: MACBA (the modern art museum) or the CCCB (a contemporary culture museum).\nAnother can\u2019t miss in this area is the enormous bronze cat sculpture (El Gat) by renowned Colombian artist Fernando Botero.\nFlamenco\nWe round out the evening taking in a show of not only one of the most popular art forms in Spain, but the entire world.\nThe Barcelona flamenco shows at the Patio Andaluz have been known to bring guests to tears, and you\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re one of them watching the intricate dances, passionate yelps, and spirited guitar rhythms.\nShows run daily at 7:45pm, 9:45pm, and 10:10pm and can include drinks and dinner.\n", "itin_vector": [0.03389120474457741, -0.020890086889266968, -0.036106087267398834, -0.008299530483782291, -0.008098847232758999, -0.017587438225746155, 0.02285933867096901,

{"itinerary": "Travel itinerary for four days.", "plan": " \nWhat to See in Barcelona in 4 Days: Day One\nPla\u00e7a Catalunya (Catalonia Square)\nAny four day Barcelona itinerary should start in the square from which much of Barcelona\u2019s social life unfolds.\n\nPla\u00e7a Catalunya is one of the largest and liveliest squares in Barcelona, \u200b\u200band also a strategic meeting point for moving to other areas of the city.\nSince its construction in 1927, it has been a meeting place for locals and tourists.\nAround Pla\u00e7a Catalunya there are large department stores (including the emblematic El Corte Ingl\u00e9s), chain restaurants like the Hard Rock Cafe, and fast food outlets.\nLas Ramblas and Boqueria Market\nSouth of Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, towards the sea, stretches the famous La Rambla, one of the most emblematic streets of Barcelona.\nThis pedestrian street stretches for about 1.2 kilometres, from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya to Port Vell, the old port.\nIt is an unmissable walk for those visiting Barcelona for the first time: street artists, mimes, and all sorts of eccentricities feature here, as well as historic flower and candy kiosks.\n\nOne of the most loved stops along the Rambla, and one that you can\u2019t miss, is the marvellous Boqueria market.\n\nThis massive, covered food market will be your paradise if you love local eats: both for eating and photographing.\nCheck out its vibrant colours by sampling fruits, vegetables, sweets, and spices.\nOn the other hand, you can stop by one of the tapas restaurants for a nice breakfast or lunch.\nGothic Quarter\n4 days in Barcelona Spain wouldn\u2019t be complete without the narrow streets of the Barrio G\u00f3tico.\nThis was the first urban nucleus of Barcelona in Roman times, when the city was called Barcino.\nFounded by the Romans in the 1st century BC, Barcino was an important strategic and commercial settlement.\nThe traces of this ancient city can still be found in today\u2019s Barrio G\u00f3tico, such as the stretch of Roman wall surrounding Barcelona Cathedral.\nToday, the Gothic Quarter is a fascinating combination of history, delightful corners such as Pla\u00e7a de Sant Felipe Neri or the mysterious Pont del Bisbe, and modern art and craft galleries.\n\nAlso include in your itinerary a visit to Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, now the seat of the City Council and the Generalitat of Barcelona, \u200b\u200band the center of the most famous folkloric events in the city.\nLunch in El Gotico\n\nAfter so much strolling through the stories and mysteries of the historic center of Barcelona, \u200b\u200byou\u2019re probably feeling peckish.\nHere\u2019s some great lunch spots:\nCan Culleretes (Carrer d\u2019en Quintana, 5),\nBodega Vasconia (Carrer d\u2019en Gign\u00e0s, 13)\nEl Louro (Rambla dels Capuchins , 37)\nOptional visit: Barrio del Raval and MACBA\nIf you prefer multicultural neighborhoods you can visit El Raval, a neighborhood a few steps from the Rambla.\nThe Raval is a neighborhood full of contradictions, where trendy streets alternate with a lively art scene, excellent restaurants with international cuisine.\nIn the past, it was considered one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Barcelona.\nDespite its numerous problems to be solved, it\u2019s an area where associations are actively engaged in the promotion of social and cultural inclusion.\na skateboarder takes a jump at macba in raval neighbourhood barcelona\nUrban redevelopment projects and integration programs have contributed to improving the quality of life in the neighbourhood.\nOne of its most famous and visited cultural centers is the MACBA (Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona), which houses a rich collection of contemporary art works.\n\nAgain, when considering what to do in four days this is by no means a must \u2013 I\u2019d say this is only for the most adventurous travellers.\nSagrada Familia\nThe final stop on this first day in Barcelona is the Sagrada Familia, the incredible basilica designed by the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed.\nThis extraordinary modernist-style building is still under construction, which is why some call it \"the infinite project\".\nIt began in 1882 and for the moment it is expected that it will be completed in 2026, on the occasion of the centenary of the architect\u2019s death.\nDespite this, it\u2019s firmly at the top of my list of best things to do in Barcelona.\nAdmire its splendid facades carved with biblical episodes, the mystical lights of its interior generated by the stained glass windows, and the panoramic view from one of the two Sagrada Familia towers that can be visited.\nWhen talking of the must sees in Barcelona in 4 days this is firmly at the top.\nNaturally, Sagrada Familia is one of the most visited monuments in the world, \u200b\u200bso it is essential to book your ticket in advance.\n\n \nHow to Spend 4 Days in Barcelona: Day Two\nPark G\u00fcell\nStart the day at Park G\u00fcell, a public park with beautiful mosaic terraces and buildings that look like the sugar houses from the Grimm brothers\u2019 fairy tales.\nParc G\u00fcell offers a panoramic view of the city and an immersive experience into the mind of Gaud\u00ed, who designed the park in 1900 for entrepreneur Eusebi G\u00fcell.\n\nStroll through the park\u2019s gardens and admire the many architectural details that Gaud\u00ed has \u200b\u200bscattered throughout the avenues and green areas.\n\nStart, for example, from the colourful salamander resting slyly on the staircase at the entrance to the park.\nThen, don\u2019t miss the other monumental areas: the Plaza de la Naturaleza and it\u2019s incredible mosaic benches, the hypostyle hall with the Doric columns that support it, and the curious P\u00f3rtico de la Lavandera.\nWith the entrance ticket to Park G\u00fcell you can visit the Monumental Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and stroll through the green and panoramic areas of the park.\nBarrio de Gr\u00e0cia and Casa Vicens\nOne of the best things to do near Park Guell is exploring the neighborhood of Gr\u00e0cia.\nI love this bohemian neighborhood for its charming streets, sustainable clothing and handicraft shops \u2013 as well as a super underrated Barcelona nightlife scene.\nSome of its picturesque squares never sleep (much to the delight of the neighbours!), such as Pla\u00e7a del Sol and Pla\u00e7a del Diamant: come here if you want to enjoy a coffee or beer in a scene from a movie.\nBut, Gr\u00e0cia\u2019s bars and shopping aren\u2019t the only reason to visit: here there is also an architectural jewel called Casa Vicens, one of the first works of Gaud\u00ed.\n\nThis modernist-style house is a marvel of intricate detailing and nature-inspired floral motifs \u2013 its distinctive feature, which will make you recognize it from a distance, is its facade decorated with green and white ceramic tiles.\nAlso, one of the top things to do in four days is visit the interior of the house \u2013 to admire the art and craftsmanship that characterize it.\nPasseig de Gr\u00e0cia, La Pedrera, Casa Batll\u00f3\nAfter the elegant Casa Vicens, I\u2019d move onto Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia: Barcelona\u2019s most elegant boulevard.\nHere, you can continue your itinerary among the houses of Catalan nobility.\nSome of the most elegant boutiques in the city were born on this street and, even today, this street welcomes tourists and business people in its luxury hotels.\nIt\u2019s also one of the best places for shopping in Barcelona, especially if you\u2019re looking for elite brands.\nCasa Batll\u00f2 is one of the architectural marvels by Antoni Gaud\u00ed that attracts millions of tourists every year.\n\nYou recognize it by its unique facade, decorated with colourful mosaics, and undulating balconies that look straight out of a fairy tale.\nI strongly recommend visiting the Casa Batllo interior.\n\nEven the roof of the building hides surprises, original sculptures, and a panoramic view over the whole city.\nAlso on Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, ten minutes from Casa Batll\u00f2, is La Pedrera (official name is Casa Mil\u00e0), another masterpiece by Gaud\u00ed.\nIt has a sinuous shape and looms over the Passeig looking like a wave in building form \u2013 or even a block of jello.\nVisit it and get up to the garden of warriors rooftop \u2013 one of the most spectacular perches in Europe.\n \nWhat to Do in Barcelona in Four Days: Day Three\nThe El Born District\nEl Born is another of the areas of Barcelona which, like the Gothic Quarter, has been able to harmonize the memory of the past with the lively modernity of the present.\nAmong its cobbled streets and old buildings of the medieval merchants of Barcelona, \u200b\u200byou\u2019ll find trendy boutiques, art and craft galleries, and endless Barcelona tapas restaurants.\nOne of its architectural jewels is the Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar, an imposing Gothic church dating back to the 14th century.\nIts majestic Barcelona architecture and large windows create an evocative atmosphere, while its stark and bright interior inspires tranquillity and devotion.\nIf you are a fan of historical novels, perhaps you have already heard of the Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar thanks to the enormous success of Ildefonso Falcones\u2019 book \"The Cathedral of the Sea\".\nThis historical novel set in the fourteenth century tells the story of a young worker building the Basilica. The novel helped spread interest in this magnificent church, making it even more iconic in Barcelona culture and literature.\nA few steps from the Basilica is the Picasso Museum (Carrer de Montcada, 15-23), an unmissable stop if you love art.\nThis museum houses the world\u2019s largest collection of works by Pablo Picasso and offers a fascinating perspective on his artistic evolution and his talent.\nLunch in the Born District\nAgain, when thinking of places to visit in Barcelona in 4 days restaurants are always my top suggestions.\nFor a quality foodie foray (because beauty makes you hungry!) you can count on the main market of the neighborhood: the Santa Caterina Market (Avenida de Francesc Camb\u00f3, 16).\n\nIt\u2019s one of the top markets in Barcelona.\nWith its distinctive modern structure and colorful undulating roofs, this market is renowned for its wide selection of fresh produce including fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, and local food products.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect place to immerse yourself in the culinary culture of Barcelona and to taste local delicacies.\nIf, on the other hand, you prefer a more classic sit down restaurant here\u2019s my favourites:\nEl Foro (Carrer Princesa 53): Argentinian steak restaurant\nNou Celler (Carrer Princesa 16): Traditional Catalan cuisine\nBormuth (Pla\u00e7a Comercial 1) : Great classic Spanish tapas\nCiutadella Park\nAfter lunch, a nice place to relax is Ciutadella Park (Passeig de Picasso, 21), an oasis of calm just a few steps away from the crowds of the Born.\n\nHere you can relax, take a snooze on the lawn, or take a ride on the lake by renting a rowboat.\nWith its 17 hectares, Ciutadella Park it is one of the largest + best parks in Barcelona with expansive lawns, ponds, fountains, flower gardens and picnic areas.\nBuilt between 1875 and 1888, the park also has great historical importance because it was the site of the former military citadel, commissioned by Philip V to dominate the city after the War of the Spanish Succession.\nOne of my favorite corners is undoubtedly the Ciutadella Lake which rises at the foot of the Monumental waterfall.\nThe Waterfall is a sculpture designed and engineered by Josep Fontser\u00e9 with the help of a very young Antoni Gaud\u00ed.\nThe main motif of the sculpture, which rises in the center under four gilded horses, is the birth of venus \u2013 portrayed by the Catalan sculptor Venanci Vallmitjana.\nPalau de la M\u00fasica Catalana\nAfter your relaxing break in the park, I\u2019d kick off the afternoon with a visit to the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana, a building of architectural excellence that hosts concerts and classical music performances.\n\nPersonally, as a first-time visitor to the city I\u2019d take in one of Barcelona\u2019s best flamenco shows there.\nDesigned by the Catalan architect Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner between 1905 and 1908, the Palau soon became a symbol of Barcelona\u2019s cultural identity.\n\nIt was inaugurated on February 9, 1908, and has been one of the leading theaters for music and the performing arts in the city ever since. Since 1997 it has been proclaimed a UNESCO heritage site.\n\nThis is one of my best things to do in Barcelona on a rainy day.\nFrom an architectural point of view, the Palau is a modernist masterpiece and you can see it even if you admire it from the outside.\n\nIts impressive exterior facade, which appears to light up the street, features an intricate design of brick and red stone pillars, mosaics, and stained glass windows.\n\nThe interior is wonderful: long rows of windows allow the concert hall to receive natural light while a stained glass dome shines in the center of the ceiling.\nOld Port and Barceloneta\nHow to spend the rest of the third afternoon on your Barcelona 4 day itinerary?\n\nMy idea is to dedicate it to the most relaxing neighborhood in Barcelona: go down to the sea and discover the Port Vell and Barceloneta area.\nThe Port Vell is located in the lower part of the city, a few steps from the end of the Rambla and the monument to Christopher Columbus who, with his right arm extended, points his index finger towards the sea.\nPort Vell is the old port of Barcelona: before the restoration that took place for the 1992 Summer Olympics, this was a port area of \u200b\u200bempty warehouses, marshalling yards and factories.\n\nFrom the beautiful building of the Autoridad Portuaria, just in front of the Rambla de Mar bridge, you can walk along the marina, admire the moored boats, and walk over to Barceloneta.\n\nAlong the way you\u2019ll see sculptures that now characterize the landscape of this area of \u200b\u200bBarcelona, \u200b\u200bsuch as La Gamba (The Shrimp) by Javier Mariscal and La Cara de Barcelona (The Face of Barcelona) by American pop artist Roy Lichtenstein.\nIn Barceloneta, the seaside district famous for its sandy beaches and fresh fish restaurants, you can treat yourself to a few hours of relaxation to end the day.\nBefore the 1992 Olympics, this was still a traditional fishing district: its seafaring authenticity has not been completely lost and continues to emerge despite the great changes induced by tourism.\nStart from its central square, the one where the neighborhood market is also located: Pla\u00e7a del Poeta Bosc\u00e1.\nHere, you can still find small treasures of 19th-century building decoration and clear signs of pride on the part of its inhabitants, who often hang the barrio\u2019s yellow-blue flag from their balconies.\n\nOne of the symbols of Barceloneta\u2019s post-Olympics transformation can be found on the beach: the famous vertical sculpture known as The Cubes of Barceloneta.\nIn reality, its real name is Estel Ferit, which in Catalan means \"wounded star\".\nThe four cubes that compose it immortalize the popular huts of the Barceloneta coast and which were eliminated before the Olympics.\n\nAnother iconic image of the neighborhood is the iconic Hotel W (Pla\u00e7a Rosa Del Vents 1), also called Hotel Vela, at the end of the Barceloneta beach. Its sail-shaped profile lights up with different colors in the evening.\nIf you want to take a walk with the sound of ebbing waves, the Mirador Vela and the Mirador del Mediterr\u00e1nei open up behind the hotel, two long avenues from which it seems you can embrace the sea and all of Barcelona.\nIf the weather permits, the best way to enjoy Barceloneta is to sunbathe on one of Barcelona\u2019s best beaches.\nFor an even more chill experience, sit at one of the many chiringuitos (beach bars) with a beer or mojito and watch the world go by.\nDinner in Barceloneta\nClose day three of our four day Barcelona itinerary with a traditional seafood or tapas dinner.\nIn Barceloneta, as I mentioned, there are a ton of Barcelona\u2019s top restaurants here, so you are spoiled for choice.\n\nYou can opt for vermouth and classic tapas at Bar Electricitat (Carrer de Sant Carles, 15) or for the slightly more sophisticated ones at Bitacora (Carrer de Balboa 1).\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to miss epic seafood, go on the safe side with Can Ma\u00f1o (Carrer del Baluard, 12) or Barraca (Passeig. Mar\u00edtim de la Barceloneta, 1).\nCova Fumada is another choice \u2013 it\u2019s one of my Barcelona hidden gems.\n\n4 Days in Barcelona Itinerary: Day Four\nCamp Nou\n\nCamp Nou (Carrer d\u2019Aristides Maillol, 12) is the legendary stadium of FC Barcelona, \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bone of the most famous and successful football clubs in the world.\n\nInaugurated in 1957, Camp Nou has a capacity of 99,354 spectators: the optics are impressive, you\u2019re getting the largest stadium in Spain and the third largest in Europe. It is currently under renovation.\nThis temple of football has hosted many epic matches and unforgettable moments over the years.\n\nIf football is your passion, you cannot miss a visit to the stadium.\n\nThe ticket includes the possibility to get onto the pitch and sit on the player\u2019s bench, to visit the challenging team\u2019s locker room, the press room and the VIP room.\n\nYou can also visit the Barcelona F.C. Museum, with all the trophies, memorabilia, and objects related to the history of the club and its most famous players like Messi.\n\nMontju\u00efc\n\nIf, on the other hand, football doesn\u2019t interest you and you much prefer a morning walking in nature, enjoy the beauty of the parks and paths of Montju\u00efc.\n\nMontju\u00efc Hill offers spectacular views of the city but also a unique combination of history, nature, and culture.\n\nIts name derives from the Catalan words Mont dels Jueus, which means \u201cMountain of the Jews\u201d: the name recalls the fact that in the Middle Ages the hill housed a Jewish cemetery.\nplant arches at montjuic barcelona.\nGarden of Joan Brossa Montjuic\n\nHistorically, Montju\u00efc has played a significant role in the history of Barcelona.\n\nIt was the site of several fortifications, including Montjuic Castle, which can still be visited today and from whose terraces you can admire almost the entire city.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Montju\u00efc was also the site of executions and political imprisonments.\n\nAmong the most visited attractions is the Poble Espanyol (Avenida de Francesc Ferrer i Gu\u00e0rdia, 13), a sort of miniature Spain rebuilt with narrow streets and squares representing different regions of the country.\n\nAmong the most interesting museums in this area, however, there are the National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC) and the Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation, which houses a vast collection of the Catalan artist\u2019s works.\nLunch at Montju\u00efc\n\nIn the Montju\u00efc area there aren\u2019t many places to eat, apart from a few tourist-gouging bars.\n\nOur advice, if you plan to be in these parts at a time when your stomach is rumbling, is to bring a packed lunch or something to nibble on.\n\nIf you pass by here on a Saturday or Sunday instead, we suggest you stop in a small open-air venue with a superb view of the commercial port of Barcelona: La Caseta del Migdia.\n\nThis is essentially a restaurant that BBQs quality food and serves it at picnic tables.\n\nAny four day tour of Barcelona should include this, especially if you love eating meat and drinking cold beer outdoors.\nJoan Mir\u00f3 Foundation\n\nThe Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation is a museum dedicated to the famous Catalan artist Joan Mir\u00f3.\n\nIt is located on the slopes of Montju\u00efc Hill and was inaugurated in 1975, shortly before the artist\u2019s death.\n\nIt was born as a foundation by the will of the artist himself, who wanted to create an artistic space of international reference in Barcelona.\n\nSubsequently, the Foundation has become a space to promote research and studies on Mir\u00f3 and contemporary art and to enhance his collection.\nNature is a key element of the foundation\u2019s architectural project.\n\nJoan Mir\u00f3 and Josep Llu\u00eds Sert \u2013 architect, close friend of the artist and project manager \u2013 chose Montju\u00efc as the site of the museum because they wanted a building integrated into nature.\n\nIn short, the vegetation becomes an integral part of the exhibition space here.\nPlaza Espa\u00f1a and the Magic Fountain\n\nEnd your four days in Barcelona in one of its busiest squares but which hides real jewels: Plaza Espa\u00f1a.\n\nYou recognize it for the iconic panorama dominated by the pair of Venetian towers.\n\nLooking through the towers, at the end of the long avenue of Avenida de la Reina Maria Cristina, the Palau Nacional de Montju\u00efc stands proudly, which today is also home to the Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya (MNAC).\n\nAll these buildings date back to 1929, the year of the Barcelona International Exposition.\nThe MNAC houses a huge collection of Catalan artwork from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, including paintings, sculptures, frescoes and decorative art objects.\n\nThe collections include works by artists such as Rubens, Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya, Tiepolo and Tintoretto.\n\nAmong the most famous works are the best examples of Romanesque frescoes, unique in Europe, which represent an important artistic and historical heritage of the region.\n\nIf you want to admire the city from above (and free!), go up to the terrace of the Las Arenas shopping center, an imposing circular building that used to be an old bullfighting stadium.\n\nTo round off your 4 day stay in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwait until the evening for the light show, water games and music of Magic Fountain Barcelona. The shows are free but times vary: check in advance.\n\nImportant: the Magic Fountain show is temporarily suspended due to a drought affecting Catalonia (July 2023).\n", "itin_vector":

days.", "plan": "The first day I recommend starting with a walk on the famous Rambla Avenue which is a long sidewalk with stalls of food, flowers, and souvenirs. Since this is a central place with lots of tourists - take good care of your bags while walking and beware of pickpockets. \n    La Boqueria Market - After about 20 minutes walk on the La Ramblas at 91 La Rambla Street is the food market La Boqueria Market. \nYou will find fruit, vegetable, juice, chocolate, meat, spice, pastry, and more stalls.\nAfter visiting the market, continue walking along the Rambla to the Gothic Quarter (Barri Gotic).\nThe Gothic Quarter is the oldest in Barcelona. There you can stroll through the beautiful alleys and the abundance of shops in the place. \nNice to walk there even in the evening and the area is bustling with life while the shops and cafes are still open.\nYou can choose to visit the Gothic Quarter independently or on a guided tour. \nThe last stop is close to the promenade so that at the end you can take the time to walk along the long promenade along which there are many stalls and it leads to the beach.\nWhat is special about Barcelona's beach is that the sand and the many palm trees in the area were brought to Barcelona especially before the Olympic Games held in the city in 1992 to upgrade the city and attract tourists - a very successful move and in recent years Barcelona has become one of the most popular cities.\nShopping lovers should know that there is also a mall called Maremagnum in the coastal area. (About 15 minutes walk away). \nWithin walking distance is also the Aquarium and the IMAX Cinema - a nice and popular place for families and children.\nAnother mall in the coastal area but in a more remote area is the Diagonal Mall which includes lots of well-known stores including Primark - the successful fashion store that sells at very equal prices.\nFrom Barceloneta beach to diagonal mall:\nMetro line L4 from Barceloneta station to Selva de mar\n If you do not want to do some shopping you can sit in one of many restaurants in Barcelona, order a beer and tapas and just enjoy the lifestyle of the Spanish peoples.\n \nThe Palau de la Musica is open for tours daily from 10:00 am to 3:30 pm.\nThere are special opening hours on Easter and the month of July from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. There are also extended hours in August from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm.\nContinue from there to Via Laietana, a central and famous main street with impressive architecture.\nFrom there continue to the impressive Arc de Triomf, formerly built in honor of the Barcelona International Exhibition.\nFrom the Arc de Triomf continue on foot to the Citadel Park called Parc de la Ciutadella located next to the Arc de Triomf.\nThe park was established in the middle of the 19th century and is impressive and beautiful. Not to be missed. It has a beautiful lake, benches, a fountain, the impressive Parliament building of Catalonia, and more.\nFrom here you can visit the El Born district, also called the La Ribera district, which is also one of the oldest and most beautiful areas in the city and is located right next to the Gothic Quarter, between Via Laietana and Ciutadella Park. \nIn this area, you will find a variety of impressive medieval palaces and buildings, some in the Picasso Museum complex. \nIt is a calm, cozy and lively area, with a variety of colorful restaurants, bars, and alleys.\n\u200dIt is recommended to end the day and get to Bunkers del Carmel, the most impressive and cool lookout in Barcelona towards sunset. \nThis is the best view point in Barcelona - a great 360-degree view of the entire city, far from the bustle of tourists, on a mountain in the heart of the El-Carmel neighborhood near a park where you can walk.\nI like observations. Just let me get away from the noise a bit, see things from a distance, get some proportions - and I'm happy. \nSo when I heard that there was a view point in the city that I had not visited I knew I had to get there.\nThe Bunkers del Carmel view point is located on a 262-meter-high mountain with the remains of fortifications erected on it during the Spanish Civil War, designed to protect against airstrikes. \nThis place is far from all the classic tourist places and therefore has almost no tourists.\nThe view is especially beautiful at sunset, but for people who especially like quiet, it is recommended to arrive in the early morning.\n\u200d\n\nA little tip - if you still decide to arrive at sunset, you will arrive about an hour before sunset and take a seat. Although the place is not very touristy because it is not easy to get to, but it is completely the favorite place of the locals and at sunset, it fills up.\n You can reach El Carmel Station by bus line 24 from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya or by the blue Metro L5 and from there take a few minutes on foot to the view point.\n\nThis day starts at the Montju\u00efc, The Mount of the Jews.\nThis is a hill topped by an old military fortress. You can ascend to the fortress at the top of the hill in Montjuic via a cable car through which you will gain a beautiful view of the entire city.\n\nA cable car in Spanish is called Telef\u00e9rico (you should keep this in mind if you want guidance from passersby in the area).\nHow to get to Montjuic?\nTo get there take the metro line l-3 or L-1 to the Plaza Espa\u00f1a (Plaza Espa\u00f1a) station.\nThe exit from the metro will lead you directly to the beautiful Espanya Square, directly opposite which you will see the Palau Nacional Palace, which we will reach later. Now get on bus line 150 (his bus stop is next to the metro).\nLine 150 ascends the mountain through several stations to the fortress at the top of Montjuic Hill.\nOne option is to get off the bus at the entrance to the fort and then get off there by cable car or on foot.\nAnother option is to get off the bus before arriving at the fort, at a station called Panicular from where the cable car leaves in the direction of up the hill (towards the fort), and then get off on foot.\nCable ticket price: \u20ac 13.70\nYou can order online\nAfter getting off the cable car, continue walking in the area towards The Olympic Stadium.\nIt is the sixth-largest stadium in Spain. It was established in 1929 and served as the main stadium for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.\nYou can also walk around the beautiful parks located in the Montju\u00efc area:\nJuan Maragall's Gardens - Jardins de Joan Maragall - only open at specific hours.\nThe Gardens of Juan Brossa Jardins de Joan Brossa\nJardins de Moss\u00e8n Costa i Llobera\nJardins de Laribal\nWalking distance from the Liberal Gardens and the Gardens of Juan Margal lies the Palau Nacional Palace built-in 1929 for the Barcelona International Exhibition and from 1934 serves as the National Museum of Art of Catalonia.\nThere is an amazing view from there that should not be missed on the whole city and also on Plaza Espa\u00f1a.\nPoble Espanyol\nFrom the palace, facing Plaza Espa\u00f1a, turn left and keep going straight in the direction of Pablo Espanyol.\nThis is an impressive site built in the shape of a Spanish village, It is very worthwhile to enter the site.\nYou will be impressed by Spanish-style buildings divided into different regions in Spain.\nThere are also nice shops with artisans who do handicrafts like glass, ceramics, jewelry, guitars, and more.\nYou can also sit down at one of the local caf\u00e9s and enjoy an authentic Spanish atmosphere. Also do not miss the film that is screened in a place that tells about the festivals that are customary in Spain.\nEntrance fee to Pablo Espanyol: Adult - 14 euros.

(From Pueblo Espanyol's gate, turn right to bus stop 150 which will take you back to Espanya Square and from there Metro l-3 to the hotel).\nThe Magic Fountains - Adjacent to Plaza Espa\u00f1a is the Magic Fountain of the Montju\u00efc.\nIf you are there during the fountain's operating hours, do not miss the fountain show.\nThe show resumes every half hour.\nShow hours:\nApril-May, October: Thursday - Saturday, 21: 00-22: 00,\nJune - September: Wednesday - Sunday, 21: 30-22: 30,\n1 November to 31 March: Thursday - Saturday, 20:00 -21: 00,\nJanuary 7 to February 28 - no shows.\n\nWhen you visit Barcelona, \u200b\u200byou should, at least for one day, behave like a local.\nVisit this special district, the Gracia district, and there is no doubt at all that your suitcase of experiences will be filled even more.\nFor those interested, there is a guided tour in a package that combines the three magnificent buildings of Gaudi.\nThe Gracia neighborhood is the oldest and most authentic neighborhood of Barcelona, \u200b\u200bincluding the well-known neighborhoods of Villa de Garcia and Garcia Nova.\nThe Garcia district was a separate settlement from the large city of Barcelona and only at the end of the 17th century was annexed to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bbut it still functions as an independent province.\nPasseig de Gr\u00e0cia was the road that led to the settlement.\nThe neighborhood is best known for the Festa Major de Gr\u00e0cia, which is celebrated every year in August, where the streets of the neighborhood are filled with colorful decorations and a variety of events and celebrations.\n\u200d\n \nThe residents of the neighborhood are young families and a lot of students and artists and it has a variety of entertainment venues and bars, along with various shops, galleries, and nice cafes.\nThe neighborhood has several beautiful squares and many restaurants as well as a nice little market called Libertat.\n \nThe main squares in the neighborhood are Pla\u00e7a De La Vila De Gr\u00e0cia, with the clock tower in the center; Placa de la Virreina, centered on an old church and Placa del Sol, home to Cafe del Sol, considered the oldest caf\u00e9 in the area.\n\u200d\nAnother interesting site in the area is Casa Vicens - the first building Gaudi designed in 1883-1878 for the ceramic manufacturer Manuel Vicens.\n\u200d\nWhat you should know about Gr\u00e0cia: The neighborhood itself is pleasant and recommended for visits and even for special shopping, spending time in cafes and getting to know the nightlife.\nFor those who are interested after some days in the heart of Barcelona's tourism, disconnect from the tourist areas and discover different atmosphere, gracia district is the place to be..\nFor shopping enthusiasts - here you will find specialty stores at cheap prices, but less famous chains and large malls.\n\u200d\nAfter strolling around Gracia you can visit Park Guell - A garden complex designed and designed by renowned architectural artist Antonio Gaudi.\nThe site was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2005.\n\u200d\nPark Guell is without a doubt one of Barcelona's most famous sites designed by Gaudi.\nHe was commissioned by Osby Goel who wanted to create a stylish park for the Barcelona nobility.\n\u200d\nThe park has multiple entrances.\nThe most impressive is the main entrance from Carrer d'Olot.\n\nYou will see there two pavilions one of which is a small museum and at the beginning of the stairs, there is the famous dragon statue.

\nWhen you first land in Barcelona Spain, there will be a multitude of sights vying for your attention. The city has so much to offer, that it can be quite challenging to pick and choose which attractions to see first.\nDepending on what time of year you are visiting, it will be essential to book some of the popular sights, such as the Sagrada Familia, Casa Battlo, and Park Guell, well in advance.\nIn addition to purchasing tickets for these popular tourist attractions, the Bus Turistic is a tour bus that can take you around to various popular attractions. I would highly recommend purchasing tickets ahead of time. \n During my trip, I made sure to leave sufficient gaps of time for exploring the city, so I only made reservations for a few major attractions per day. I find that this is the best way to experience a city. And there is no shortage of places to see in Barcelona!\nFrom secret alleyways to gardens, historic churches, and more, there is something to discover around every corner.\nTo get from the airport to the city centre, you can ride the Aerobus from Barcelona airport directly into town! Once you arrive in town, there are several metro stations to take you to the neighbourhood where you will be staying during your holiday.\nAfter first arriving in Barcelona, spend your first day acclimating to the neighbourhood where you have chosen to stay. As I visited during Festa De Gracia, I chose an Air BnB in the hip district of Gracia. This unique area boasts a vibrant bohemian scene with a range of cool bars, cafes, and plazas.\nVisiting Barcelona during a grand neighbourhood celebration is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Spain is a country with an endless supply of festivals, ranging from a huge tomato food fight to art exhibitions. If you can time your trip during one of the several festivals, you should! \nOriginating in 1817, Festa De Gracia is an energizing annual street festival that takes place over a period of 6 days. The small, tight-knit community of Gracia unites to create a truly spectacular extravaganza of music, food, and art.\nOne of the most unique parts of Festa de Gracia is the parade float competition, wherein each street/neighbourhood decorates one street with giant floats and displays which must be composed of recyclable materials.\nEach street comes alive with multicolour-themed displays that seem to have come right from your imagination! Massive paper mache creations dangle from the skies along every street. This festival goes beyond anything you may have seen before Gracia residents go all out, creating incredible themed decorations.\nWhen I was in Barcelona, some of the themed street displays I saw included an illuminated under-the-sea theme, rock music guitar theme, an amazon jungle theme, and a pirate ship theme.\nIn addition to this unique visual street art contest, there are endless options of things to do and foods to try. Throughout the festival, there are endless opportunities to learn various Spanish dance styles at workshops, and places to try traditional Spanish Paella, Catalan Sausage, and Esmorzars de Coca, just to name a few food options. You can also try a mojito, which is a lemon drink.\nIf you prefer a different vibe, there are over 10 districts you could explore. Each part of Barcelona has a unique personality. For example, professional shoppers will enjoy exploring the Eixxample neighbourhood. Here you will find posh shopping boutiques, luxurious hotels, and modern buildings.\nThe Old Town/El Ravel is divided into four main areas: the Gothic Quarter (Barri Gotic), El Ravel, El Born, and La Barceloneta. This is the heart of the city, the site of Ciutadella Park, the Gothic Cathedral, and the famed Picasso Museum, so it will likely attract those of you who enjoy travelling back in time to a different historical era.\nEl Ravel is another community with a bohemian vibe. This area is full of art studios and Barcelona's largest meat market, La Boqueria Market. There are also a few interesting statues in El Ravel, including El Gato de Botero.\nChill beach-goers will fall in love with Barceloneta, a modern district that was designed during the 1992 Summer Olympics. Finally, for techies, there is Sant Marti, a neighbourhood with the 38-story glass skyscraper Torre Glories and several modern technological amenities.\nAfter an afternoon of strolling through your new neighbourhood, you are sure to be hungry for a hearty meal!\nOn your first night, try a traditional meal with Paella and Patatas Bravas. One of my personal favourite tapas bars is Lalola, located on Carrer de l'Escorial. While here, be sure to try the Potatas Bravas, a snack with spicy potatoes fried in oil and smothered in a creamy, spicy sauce.\n \nDay Two: Visit the Crown Jewel of Barcelona and More!\nOn your second day, you will be well-rested and super eager to take on the town. This is the day to check a few of the top sights of Barcelona off of your must-see list.\n\nYou can begin your day with a free walking tour of Barcelona. Several tour companies offer unique tours including the Gaudi Free Tour by Runner Bean Tours.\n\nAfter roaming around all day like tourists tend to do, you will want to take a lunch break. There are several popular tapas bars along Passeig de Gracia you can try.\n\nBe brave and try something you haven't ventured to before! A few of the top-ranked choices include Cerveceria Catalana, Bar El Velodromo, and Vinitus.\n\nAfter a hearty lunch-tasting paella, vegetable dishes, unique seafood dishes, and an assortment of wines or sangria, you will be free to explore the city some more.\n\nIf you are a chocolate lover, check out Museu de la Xocolata. Located in the Gothic Quarter, this museum is open daily from 10:00 AM \u2013 7:00 PM and offers the chance to learn about the origins of chocolate and its significance to the city of Barcelona.\n\nIf you have children travelling along with you, they will enjoy finding the chocolate statues throughout the museum. Adults and children alike will surely love to sample some delicious rich chocolate!\n\nA leisurely walk through the Gothic Quarter would be a great way to spend the rest of the afternoon. This unique area features a few historical and vintage shops, restaurants, tapas bars, and museums.\n\nAmong a few select attractions include the magical Barcelona Cathedral, Placa Jaume, and the Jewish Quarter. Several walking tours also cover the Gothic Quarter, in case you are interested in doing some treasure hunting and learning about the history of Barcelona.\n\nWhile in the Gothic Quarter, don't miss visiting Els Quatre Gats, which is an art nouveau cafe notorious for being the gathering spot for artists during the 19th century. Picasso and Gaudi himself even frequented this spot! Be warned that it is quite pricey, though!\n\nLater that afternoon, make your way to the Sagrada Familia, located in the L'Eixample district of Barcelona. This is an attraction for which you will definitely want to make a reservation for at least a week before you go, to ensure that you don't waste time waiting in line (It can be quite long and take hours!).\n\nIt is a good idea to purchase the audio guide along with the basic ticket, as you will be able to learn about the history of the Sagrada Familia and be able to follow a particular sequence when navigating the grand church. I found the guided tour to be quite enlightening.\n\nThere are almost always enormous crowds around the Sagrada Familia, due to its popularity and it takes around two hours to properly see it.\n\nLate afternoon is a good time to visit the Sagrada Familia, as sunlight will strike the windows and create an incredible shower of colours through the stained glass windows inside the cathedral.\n\nThe Sagrada Familia is truly the crowning glory of Barcelona, and is an amazing architectural wonder that you cannot miss!\n Day Three: Gaudi Appreciation Day\nBegin your third morning touring the colourful Gaudi masterpiece, Parc Guell. This unique Barcelona destination located in the Gracia district is very popular and for good reason! Swarms of tourists and locals alike flock here to enjoy an architectural wonder and a relaxed natural vibe.\n\nAlthough now a beautiful park for tourists to relax and enjoy the fruits of Gaudi's architectural labour, this artistic garden was originally commissioned in 1900 as a luxury housing development for Barcelona's elite. However, by 1914, it evolved to become a parkland where people could picnic.\n\nWhile at Parc Guell, be sure to visit the Gaudi House Museum, where Gaudi himself lived until his death in 1926. If you would like to tour the gardens in a leisurely manner, 2-3 hours should be sufficient.\n\nYou can even pack a picnic brunch to enjoy while perched on the famous mosaic Serpentine Bench. Timed tickets to Parc Guell cost 10 euros and should be booked at least a week ahead of your trip here. The guided tour costs 23 Euros.\n\nAfter exploring Parc Guell, it will be time to locate a good tapas bar for lunch.You\u2019ll find several options close by, including Restaurant Terra Mia which offers Mediterranean cuisine with a diverse selection of seasonal specialities. Their tapas menu includes chorizo al brandy y romero (Chorizo sausage with brandy and rosemary), Pulpitos a la Diavola (Baby octopus in a spicy red sauce), and Calamares a la Romana (Fried coated calamari rings).\n\nAfter your fill of delicious Spanish cuisine, get ready for an afternoon of continued architectural appreciation. Spend the afternoon touring Casa Batllo, the world's best landmark 2021 winner. This incredible Gaudi creation has been called the real-life version of Claude Monet's painting, Water Lilies, and is an ocean-themed historical mansion featuring a wavy exterior, blue-green stained glass windows, and even a blue-hued grand staircase.\n\nOf course, its most distinctive characteristic is its very Gaudi-esque mosaic patterns, which even coat the chimneys and rooftops! Basic admission tickets for Casa Batllo (including an audio guide) cost 29 Euros per adult and admission is free for children under 12 years of age.\n\nIf you are a fan of cultural music, a history buff, or just someone who appreciates beauty, another tourist site you will want to add to your trip itinerary is Palau de la Musica Catalana.\n\nJust a 15-minute walk from Casa Batllo, this UNESCO World Heritage site was designed by architect Lluis Domenech I Montaner in the Catalan art nouveau style in 1908. The interior concert hall is a treat for the eye: beautiful stained glass ceilings, an ornately designed interior auditorium, and a particularly impressive central skylight in the main concert hall set this concert hall apart from others you may have seen.\n\nOriginally created as a home for Barcelona's choir, the Orfeo Catala, it serves today as a beautiful concert auditorium hosting various performers, including famed violinists, piano players, and opera singers.\n\nThe tour is well worth the price of 30 euros, but if you are interested in attending a musical concert here, you can either walk in or make a reservation on their website.\n\nBy the time evening rolls around, you will be starving for a delicious dinner. Tapas are always a popular option.\n\nOne amazing bar located near Palau de la Musica Catalana is Tosca Tapas y Vino. With a fusion-style menu, some of the highlights include empanadas filled with caramelized onions, walnuts, goat cheese, and mozzarella, traditional Catalan cured ham and danish style meatballs with almond sauce.\n\nAfter recharging at your hotel, catch the evening lights show at the Magic Fountain of Montjuic, near Placa d'Espanya. Featuring dancing water shoots choreographed to high-beat musical tunes, the fountain show is a spectacle you will not want to miss!\n\nDuring summer nights, shows take place from Wednesday to Sunday and typically last an hour at dusk. Fun Fact: During the day, you can ride the Montjuic cable car to get unparalleled views of the city from the skies!\n\nAfter a jam-packed day of touring, tapas tasting, and meandering through Spanish streets, retreat to your hotel and rest up for your future adventures in Catalonia!\nDay Four: Spend a Day Climbing Montserrat\n\nAfter a few days of exploring the urban landscape, taking a day trip to a natural oasis will be a welcome change. Spend your fourth day in Montserrat, translated as rugged mountain, where you will relish breathtaking views. This Spanish mountaintop is the perfect getaway from bustling Barcelona, providing a tranquil retreat for those of us who need a little nature time. This unique spot is a hiking destination and a religious pilgrimage.\n\nAlthough there are many forms of transport to Montserrat, a cheap and scenic option is to take the one-hour train ride from Placa Espanya in Barcelona to Aeri de Montserrat. A roundtrip adult fare costs 11.50 euros and takes approximately 1 hour from Barcelona.\n\nOnce you arrive at Aeri de Montserrat, you can ride the cable car 30 minutes to the Basilica and Benedictine Abbey.\n\nThere are also alternative packages that include lunch and admission to the Montserrat Monastery Museum if you are inclined to learn about the history and significance behind this church.\n\nAccording to historical legends, Montserrat was first settled by monks in the ninth century, when the four chapels were originally built. You can learn all about the monastery's origins at the museum, which should take no more than half an hour to view.\n\nInterestingly enough, about a hundred monks still reside at the Montserrat Monastery today. Several locals take a religious trip to Montserrat to be blessed by the Black Madonna. You can certainly add this to your list of things to see at Montserrat, but know that you may be stuck waiting in line for hours.\n\nBe prepared with snacks, drinks, and perhaps some travel games, if you are accompanied by kids! If possible, check the weather forecast and schedule your day trip to Montserrat on a sunny day, as you will likely be spending most of the day outdoors. The Basilica is open from 7 AM to 8 PM.\n\nThe hike to Montserrat is most definitely a 10/10 for its incredible scenery. It is moderate in difficulty, but there are several options if you are not an avid hiker, and are just there for the views.\n\nHiking to the top will take approximately 1-1.5 hours to climb 5 km; you can also take the cable car to/from Aeri Montserrat, which will cost 20 euros. We chose to take the cable car/funicular, and it was quite a scenic ride.\n\nOnce you are at the top of Montserrat, you will be able to visit the Benedictine Abbey, the Basilica, and a small museum.\n\nThere are also smaller, lesser-known landmarks and sites that you will want to check out while at Montserrat. These include the Santa Cova Chapel, Sant Miquel's Cross, and Sant Jerome, which is the absolute top of Montserrat.\n\nOverall, Montserrat should rank high on your priority list while visiting Catalonia. You will not be disappointed!\n \nDay Five: Visit one of the Glittering Villages along the Costa Brava\n\nIn awe of sparkling aqua-blue waters and sandy beaches? Love traipsing through cobblestone historical villages? More of an art lover?  Then the Costa Brava is an essential addition to your travel plans! No trip to Barcelona would be complete without a stop along with this constellation of little seaside towns.\n\nThe Costa Brava is a string of quaint and cultured hamlets along the Spanish stretch of the splendid Mediterranean coast.\n\nIf you are limited to just six days in total, you will likely only be able to visit a couple of the towns along the Costa Brava.\n\nHow to limit yourself to just one? This, my friend, is the challenge of short trips to Barcelona! There is just too much to see! Nevertheless, you can choose the perfect village for you, based on what you want to see.\n\nIf your perfect day consists of a day meandering through an old historic town, touring a giant, majestic cathedral, exploring a Jewish quarter, or exploring the shooting locations of Game of Thrones, then Girona is your city! This town is slightly inland from the villages located right on the coast and has retained its historical charm.\n\nYou can easily pass 12+ hours here by taking Instagram-worthy shots against the Eiffel Bridge (built by the same architect who designed the Eiffel Tower, passing through the ancient Roman-built walls that encircle Girona, seeing the massive Girona Cathedral, visiting a cool cycle-themed caf\u00e9 and touring the ancient Arab baths.\n\nFor those of you who prefer spending a day away from the city sunbathing on a pristine stretch of sand while the rolling waves crash against the beach, you will want to choose L'Estartit. This family-friendly beach town hosts various festivities throughout the year, and has all you would need for the perfect beach holiday: food, drinks, a bar, and a not-too-shabby view!\n\nIf a rainy (or sunny) day at the art museum sounds like the perfect afternoon, you may want to spend the day perusing the Dali Theatre Museum in Figueres.\n\nThis bright fire-engine-red museum is a feat to behold, but it's the spectacular paintings that you will find within its walls that are the greatest draw.\n\nThe Dali Museum holds over 2400 of Salvador Dali's works and was christened by Dali himself. Figurues is also home to the San Ferran Castle (Castell de Sant Ferran) which is a fairy-tale castle perched on a hill. This town holds the key to pure medieval magic!\n\nLast, but certainly not least (17 villages make up the Costa Brava!), if you enjoy a mix of seaside bliss, culture, festivities, and natural beauty, choose Cadaques. This eye-catching town is painted white and is home to the Cap de Creus Natural Park. This natural preserve provides unmatched scenery which will amaze you.\n\nOverall, the Costa Brava is a gem that you cannot miss during your Barcelona vacation. You will be truly grateful you made time to visit one (or ten!) of these towns and will have made memories to last a lifetime.\n \nDay Six: Your Last Day in Barcelona\n\nBefore long, it will come time for you to bid farewell to the city of your dreams. Although this is your final vacation day, be sure to enjoy it to the fullest!\n\nWe recommend you spend your last day shopping for last-minute souvenirs along Passeig de Gracia and stopping by La Boqueria Meat Market, which is the largest meat market in the city. Here, you will find a vast selection of fresh fruits, meats, seafood, vegetables, and other delicacies and snacks. Come hungry, and leave with a full belly!\n\nAfter lunch, you can stroll through Old Town's La Ribera District and take a trip to the Picasso Museum. This is well worth the 12 euros it costs to see Picasso's largest collection of art. Even if you aren't a huge fan of his work, don't miss this museum, as there is nothing like it!\n\nAs the day turns to dusk, stroll through the green Parc de la Ciutadella, a beautiful zoological-themed park in the city's northeastern corner that offers picnic spots a plenty (or the perfect place to devour a gelato or caf\u00e9 con chocolate), a central fountain, and even a boating pond which is open from March through September.\n\nFind a space to catch the beautiful sunset. It will be the perfect spot to savour the last few moments of your stay.\n\nAnd there you have it! Six days in the cherished Catalan capital.

You can reach it in just 10 minutes on foot from the Barrio Gotico.\nLa Rambla is a must during a one-week stay in Barcelona. It\u2019s very lively, hosts numerous street artists and is lined with restaurants, shops, and cafes.\nFor this journey, I suggest you first walk down towards the port.\nOn the way, you should see:\n\nGran Teatre del Liceu (the city\u2019s oldest theater)\nJoan Mir\u00f3 mosaic\nPla\u00e7a Reial.\n\nThen head back towards Pla\u00e7a Catalunya.

The market is often crowded, except in the morning between 8 AM and 10 AM when it\u2019s calmer.\nVoyage Tips - AdviceDo you enjoy slightly unusual guided tours? Then you can choose the special market tour accompanied by a chef who then prepares tapas and paella to share right in front of you. Book directly by clicking here! Boqueria Market\nD. Casa Batll\u00f3\nContinue the tour by now heading to Passeig de Gracia.

This villa is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and it\u2019s open for interior visits as well.\nVoyage Tips - AdviceAvoid the never-ending queue at Casa Batll\u00f3\u2019s entrance by purchasing your ticket in advance.

Casa Mil\u00e0\nNext, I suggest continuing your tour along Passeig de Gracia, heading a little further north.\nIn 6-7 minutes, you\u2019ll arrive in front of another villa conceived by Gaud\u00ed: Casa Mil\u00e0. Equally essential as the last, Casa Mil\u00e0 features a striking white facade with flowing lines.\nHere too, you should visit the interior to immerse yourself in the architect\u2019s genius across the building\u2019s 5 different floors.\nAnd at the very top on the villa\u2019s rooftop terrace, you can enjoy a breathtaking view of the entire district.\nHere as well, remember to purchase your Casa Mil\u00e0 entry ticket on Tiqets and take advantage of the discount you get with your Barcelona City Pass.\nVoyage Tips - AdviceFor an unusual visit, choose a nighttime entry ticket.

Casa Mila, a must-do on a week\u2019s itinerary in Barcelona\nF. Attend a Flamenco Show\nWhat better way to end your first day in Barcelona than by attending a flamenco show?\nPerformances take place year-round in the city\u2019s tablaos, intimate venues where you can eat, have a drink, and enjoy musical performances.\nI especially recommend Los Tarantos, one of the oldest and most famous tablaos in the city. It\u2019s located on Pla\u00e7a Reia, very close to the Rambla.\nYou can book your flamenco evening simply by clicking here!\nIf tickets are sold out, here are some other places to see a flamenco show during your stay in Barcelona :\nCity Hall, in the theater of Barcelona City Hall\nAt the tablao Flamenco Cordobes, in Rambla district\nTablao de Carmen, located in Poble Espanyol district.\nWhat to Do and See in Barcelona on the Second Day?\nA week in Barcelona Itinerary day 2\nVisits for Day 2:\nA. Park G\u00fcell\nB. Bunkers del Carmel\nC. Recinta Modernista de Sant Pau\nD. Sagrada Familia\nE. El Born District\nA. Park G\u00fcell\nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, I suggest you start this second day with a stroll in Park G\u00fcell.\nAlso born from the imagination of Antoni Gaud\u00ed, it was built in the early 1900s. It represents another major and iconic work of the architect in Barcelona.\nPark G\u00fcell is located to the north of the city and is divided into two sections. One part is free while the other has an entrance fee.\nIn the paid area (called Monumental), you\u2019ll be able to admire famous works by Gaud\u00ed including a serpentine bench covered in mosaic, a salamander, and tree trunk-shaped columns.\nI recommend getting there early in the morning to have enough time to visit everything at a leisurely pace.\nTo get to Park G\u00fcell, take line 3 of the metro and get off at Vallcarca.\nVoyage Tips - AdviceAccess to the park is included in the Barcelona City Pass, otherwise you can also get your skip-the-line ticket right here. You should really book in advance because there is a limited number of entries each day.

Access is free and open to all.\nFor example, you might want to bring a picnic and lunch up there to have a pleasant time and recharge!\nC. Recinta Modernista de Sant Pau\nIn a 30-minute walk, proceed to Recinta Modernista de Sant Pau.\nThis former public hospital now hosts exhibitions and it\u2019s possible to visit the various buildings that tell the story of the place.\nBut it\u2019s already worth a look just for its architecture and facade!\nEntry tickets are available here, if you\u2019re tempted by the visit.\nD.

Pla\u00e7a Espanya\nFor this third day of your one-week itinerary in Barcelona, head over to Pla\u00e7a Espanya.\nConstructed in 1929, it was designed by another great Spanish architect: Puig y Cadafalch. It\u2019s somewhat the Barcelona equivalent of Place de l\u2019\u00c9toile and it\u2019s the starting point for today\u2019s other visits.\nThis square is also surrounded by several buildings and convention halls, including Las Arenas, a former bullring converted into a shopping center.\nVoyage Tips - Advice You should definitely go to the rooftop terrace of Las Arenas to enjoy the exceptional view.\nB.

Montjuic Park\nAfter this cultural visit, it should be time for lunch.\nThus, I suggest going for a picnic in Montjuic Park, the main green space in Barcelona where locals usually come to exercise and get some fresh air on weekends or after work.\nThis park is situated up high, perched on Montjuic hill and can be reached by funicular (Return ticket for the cable car here.).\nDivided into several gardens, the park also includes some historical monuments and museums:\n\nThe Police Museum\nThe Modern Art Museum\nThe Olympic Museum\nThe Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation.\nD. The Olympic installations\nThe Barcelona Olympics took place in 1992 and the city has preserved many of the installations built for the event.\nI now suggest going to see the Olympic installations located within Montjuic\u2019s Olympic Park, near the gardens.\nHere are some sites you can see:\n\nThe Olympic Stadium\nThe Palau Sant Jordi\nThe Calatrava Tower\nBarcelona\u2019s Sports Palace\nThe Pavilion of Industrial Spain.\n\nVisit the Olympic Park during your 1 week in Barcelona\nE.

Port Vell\nB. Passeig Maritim\nC. Olympic Port\nD. Ciutadella Park\nE. Santa Maria del Mar Basilica\nA. Port Vell\nContinue your week-long journey in Barcelona with a visit to Port Vell (which means Old Port).\nAs its name suggests, it\u2019s the city\u2019s oldest port and offers a pleasant stroll, especially along the charming Moll de la Fusta (Wood Quay).\nYou will also find the Rambla de Mar, a floating walkway leading to the port\u2019s shopping center for any shopping desires. You can also enjoy the walk to climb to the top of the Columbus Monument or visit the Barcelona Aquarium.\nFrom the port, you can also board a golondrina for a mini cruise around the harbor.\nCatamaran cruises (during the day or at sunset) are also available if you\u2019d like to enjoy a moment of relaxation while admiring beautiful views over the city.\nB.

Santa Maria del Mar Basilica\nTo finish off this fourth day, I recommend a visit to the Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar.\nThis Gothic basilica is located in the historic El Born district. It\u2019s very impressive both inside and out, and even more beautiful at night when it\u2019s all lit up.\nFrom the Terraces (paid access), you can enjoy a magnificent view over the entire area.\nVoyage Tips - AdviceFor the evening, you can choose between one of these 3 activities I\u2019ve selected for you:  A guided tour of the best Tapas in Barcelona who will take you to several small local bars to sample 8 courses of tapas, accompanied by a drink at each stop A pub crawl with complimentary drinks + VIP club entry to a nightclub A ghost-themed tour where you\u2019ll walk through the Gothic Quarter with a guide who\u2019ll tell you lots of spooky, supernatural stories. \n\nDay 5 \u2013 A Day at Port Aventura\nSpend a week in Barcelona and you\u2019ll have time to get out of the city to explore its surroundings.\nIn 4 days, you should have seen the main attractions of the Catalan capital. That\u2019s why for this fifth day, I recommend a trip to PortAventura, a must-visit destination near Barcelona.\nPortAventura is the largest amusement park in Spain and indeed in the whole Southern Europe.\nLocated just over an hour\u2019s drive from Barcelona (by train or car).\nTo visit Port Aventura without a car, the easiest is to book a full-day excursion including roundtrip transportation.\n\nDay 6 \u2013 Visit Montserrat\n\nFor this sixth day, I suggest another \"day-trip\" around the Catalan capital, this time to the Montserrat mountains.\n\nAgain, this is a must-visit destination near Barcelona, a place where you can recharge and enjoy the peace after the hustle and bustle of the city and the thrill rides.\n\nThe Montserrat Mountains are both a Benedictine monastery (with a beautiful abbey worth visiting), a nature reserve, and a sanctuary for Catalan culture and art. You can enjoy lovely visits as well as beautiful walks.\nWhat to do in Montserrat:\n\tVisit Montserrat Abbey\n\tExplore artworks by Caravaggio, Fortuny, Rusi\u00f1ol, Picasso, Dali, and many others.\n\tAdmire the Black Madonna\n\tHike in nature\n\tTaste the local liqueurs.\n\nDay 7 \u2013 The Costa Brava\n\nYour one-week itinerary in Barcelona is coming to an end, and I have saved a fantastic excursion for your last day: a dreamy day on the Costa Brava!\n\nThe Costa Brava, located in the northern part of Catalonia, is one of the most famous and renowned Spanish coasts.\n\nFor this seventh day, I suggest you book a day-trip that includes a boat tour as well as the discovery of the idyllic villages of Lloret de Mar and Tossa de Mar.\nThis day-trip includes coach transport and a guide.\nAnd for the more adventurous, you have another option to discover the Costa Brava: a kayak tour that also includes snorkeling (lasting 8 hours).\nSuitable for up to 12 people, this package includes transfers to Costa Brava, a kayak tour, and a snorkeling session.\nEquipment is provided and lunch is included.\n", "itin_vector": [0.02207840420305729, -0.008475412614643574,
